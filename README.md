# Voice-to-Text Framework in Python

Welcome to the Voice-to-Text framework, an end-to-end solution built using Python. This framework leverages the power of the `speech_recognition` library along with other essential tools to seamlessly convert spoken words into text. The primary goal is to make the process of transcribing voice recordings or real-time audio from a microphone straightforward and efficient.

## Features:
- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizing the `speech_recognition` library, this framework enables accurate and reliable speech-to-text conversion.

- **Microphone Recording:** Easily capture audio input from the microphone using the `sounddevice` library, allowing real-time voice recognition.

- **File Handling:** Support for reading audio data from a file and saving the recognized text to a separate file.

## Getting Started:
1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required libraries by running: `pip install SpeechRecognition sounddevice numpy scipy`

2. **Usage:**
   - Modify the `test_filename`, `FILENAME_FROM_MIC`, and `VOICE_TEXT_FILENAME` variables to suit your file paths and naming preferences.

   - Run the script to capture audio from the microphone, perform voice recognition, and save the transcribed text to a file.

3. **Customization:**
   - Extend the functionality as needed, such as implementing additional processing steps or integrating with other libraries.

## Example Usage:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav

# Set your file paths
test_filename = ""
FILENAME_FROM_MIC = "RECORDING.WAV"
VOICE_TEXT_FILENAME = "VOICE_AS_TEXT.txt"

# ... [Rest of the code remains the same]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recognize_from_microphone(FILENAME_FROM_MIC)
    text_from_voice = recognize_from_file(FILENAME_FROM_MIC)
    save_text_to_file(text_from_voice, VOICE_TEXT_FILENAME)
```

Feel free to explore and enhance this framework to meet your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to contribute and make this project even better. Happy coding!
